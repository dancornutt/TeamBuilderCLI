# TeamBuilderCLI

The intent of this project is to create a team web site through a CLI Command Line Interface. The CLI interface will prompt the user with a series of questions based on which type of team member they are adding. Team member types are Manager (one per team), Engineer, and Intern. After the user is done with one team member the CLI will ask if the user is done create the team. The user can select 'N' for no and add another team member. Once the user is done creating the team, the CLI generates the team.html page in the output folder at the working directory.

## Getting Started

Luckily this is a static site so there isn't much set-up to do. knowledge of javascript would be helpful if you would like to add more functionality to the weather app.
View the site here: [Weather App](https://dancornutt.github.io/UWB-06HW-WeatherDashboard/)

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have a good text editor or IDE for making edits to the code. For this project VS Code was used and was very useful.
Below are the tools used for this site:
    * Text Editor
    * Git
    * Github account
    * Inquirer
    * Jest
    * Browser (Chrome was used for development)

### Installing

These are the installation steps to get the site up and running:

    * Log into Github
    * Fork this repo 
    * Clone your Forked repo on your local machine
    * Navigate to the working directory containing app.js
    * run 'npm i' to install dependencies
    * run 'node app.js' to start the CLI
    * View the html page within the outputs folder to see the automated site

## Running the tests

The unit tests can be ran by the running the command 'node test', you'll need to be at the correct working directory.

## Deployment

This site isn't hosted at GitHub. To view the finished html page, just host locally at localhost port 3000.
